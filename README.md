# Feature-Analysis-On-Californian-Wildfires
In-progress research project. 

Research Questions:

a) What are the relative importance of various climate, landscape, and anthropomorphic features in machine learning modeling of Californian wildfires?
b) What is the best subset of features to use which minimizes complexity and overfitting while maximizing accuracy?
c) How well can machine learning models predict Californian wildfires based on previously-calculated subset of features?
